# Live-Weather-Station-NodeMCU
The Live Weather Station project uses a NodeMCU ESP8266 microcontroller to collect and display real-time environmental data such as temperature, humidity, and atmospheric pressure. The sensor data is uploaded to a cloud platform or displayed on a web dashboard via Wi-Fi, allowing users to monitor live weather conditions from anywhere.
